Multi-variant forecasting for understanding world hunger index.

The Global Hunger Index is a tool that attempts to measure hunger-related parameters for a country and thereby rank it accordingly. Using the GHI dataset this project aims to build the machine learning model which forecasts the GHI of every country and based on the prediction which parameters need to be worked out to improvise the India Hunger index.

The problem case is primarily if we want to go for a next coming year on the GHI there is a need for new method which will be able to work with only 4 parameters thatâ€™s why this is a problem of importance. Traditional Prediction models are not applicable here because of limited data size so we are going for sling shot or one-shot learning or any other pretrained model. So that is why, the Novelty in this particular project lies in how these models are going to be made adaptable for this specific use case.

For Prediction Problem case there is a need for large amount of the data. Unfortunately, in the GHI dataset the amount of data is very less. GHI dataset has only 4 instances of data items available for period of 20 years which is spanning to 1 entry for 4 years on an average.


So I have Implemented some of the machine learning models and tried to forecast the values.As it is time series dataset with each country with other it is challenging in order to forecast.So, for initial implementations I am using existing machine learning models

In conclusion, the findings of my research demonstrates that machine learning techniques can be effectively applied to forecast the Global Hunger Index with a reasonable level of accuracy. The RMSE of 10 suggests that the models developed in this study can provide reliable predictions of GHI, which can inform policy decisions related to food security and aid allocation.
